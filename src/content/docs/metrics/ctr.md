## CTR (Click-Through Rate)

### Definition
Click rate, proportion between clicks and [impressions](/metrics/impression).

### Formula
```
CTR = (Clicks ÷ Impressions) × 100
```

### Example
1,000 views, 50 clicks → CTR = 5%.

> [!TIP]
> Higher CTR generally indicates more relevant ads. Average CTR varies by industry, but 2-5% is typical for search ads.

> [!WARNING]
> High CTR with low conversion rate might indicate misleading ad copy or poor landing page experience.
