## CPC (Cost Per Click)

### Definition
Average cost paid for a click on an ad.

### Formula
```
CPC = Total Cost ÷ Total Clicks
```

### Example
100 clicks cost €50, CPC = €0.50.

> [!TIP]
> Lower CPC generally means more efficient ad spending, but should be balanced with conversion quality.

> [!WARNING]
> Very low CPC might indicate poor ad targeting or low-quality traffic that doesn't convert.
