## CPM (Cost Per Mille)

### Definition
Cost for one thousand [impressions](/metrics/impression) (displays) of an ad.

### Formula
```
CPM = (Total Ad Spend ÷ Impressions) × 1,000
```

### Example
A CPM of €4 means 1,000 views cost €4.

> [!TIP]
> CPM is most relevant for brand awareness campaigns. Lower CPMs allow broader reach within the same budget.

> [!NOTE]
> CPM bidding focuses on impressions, not clicks or conversions. Best for awareness rather than direct response goals.
