## ROAS (Return On Ad Spend)

### Definition
Return on advertising spend.

### Formula
```
ROAS = Revenue from Ads ÷ Cost of Ads
```

### Example
€100 invested → €500 in sales → ROAS = 5.

> [!TIP]
> A ROAS of 4:1 or higher is generally considered good, but this varies by industry and profit margins.

> [!NOTE]
> ROAS focuses on revenue, not profit. Consider your profit margins when evaluating ROAS performance.
